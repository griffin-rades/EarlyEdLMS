The server hosting the website is no longer active. This was my final project for my Web Development 2 class.
This project was built using the CodeIgniter 4 framework along with AAuth for user authentication. EarlyEdLMS was designed to 
be used by teachers of elementry school age kids or younger. The teacher are the only ones with access to view their class. They
can add notes about each student, add students to their class, grade and create assignemnts for each student, 
or message the student parents.
